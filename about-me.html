                <h2>My name is Sachin and I'm a full-stack web developer with a knack for problem-solving.</h2>

                <p><strong>I used to be a teacher</strong>. It was something I loved to do.  In my time in the classroom, I taught students of all ages, from as young as pre-school all the way through adult learners.</p>
                <p>I wasn't your average teacher.  I started as an ESL instructor.  That journey began in Nepal and India and continued for many years on a beautiful island called Jeju in South Korea.</p>

                <h3>Moving Back to Chicago</h3>
                <p>After many years abroad, my wife and I decided it was <strong>time to move back home in 2016</strong>. It was not an easy transition, but we both lucked out getting teaching jobs when we returned to Chicago.</p>
                <p>We both transitioned from teaching ESL to teaching STEM.</p>

                <h3>Teaching STEM was inspirational</h3>
                <p>I loved teaching STEM, but my wife quickly moved on to follow her dream of completing a Masters in Clinical Psychology.</p>
                <p>I became <strong>Director of Education</strong> for an after-school STEM provider.  There, I started to do amazing things.  We taught elementary school students how to build DIY robots, drones and much more.  I also found a new appreciation and fascination with coding.</p>

                <h3>Changing Careers</h3>
                <p>My wife had already made her big change, and now it was my turn.</p>
                <p>I decided to hone my skills by joining <strong>Flatiron School</strong> full time.  There, I learned some amazing new skills with a focus on full-stack web development.  The journey wasn't easy.  But neither is moving across the globe.  Now, I am finally ready to kick off this next chapter in my life as a full-stack web developer.  I can't wait to see what challenges and opportunites lie ahead.</p>
